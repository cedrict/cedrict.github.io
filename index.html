<p>This project was started with my students in mind, i.e. BSc, MSc and PhD 
Geology/Geophysics students at Utrecht University. 
With regards to the mathematics involved, I have chosen to use as little jargon as possible unless it is a term that is  
commonly found in the geodynamics literature (methods paper as well as  
application papers). There is no mathematical proof of any theorem that may 
be mentioned but I will try to refer to the appropriate sources (i.e.
Numerical Analysis, Finite Element and Linear Algebra textbooks) when possible. If you find that this books lacks references
to Sobolev spaces, Hilbert spaces, and the like, this book is just not for you.  </p>

<p>The 100+ codes I share on github are by no means optimised as I have chosen code readability 
over code efficiency. I have also often chosen to avoid resorting to multiple code 
files or even functions in order to favour a sequential reading of the codes. 
These codes are not designed to form the basis of a high-resolution high-performance geodynamics code.
Existing open source highly optimised codes shoud be preferred, such as for example
<a href="https://geodynamics.org/cig/software/aspect/" > ASPECT</a>, 
<a href="https://geodynamics.org/cig/software/citcoms/" > CitcomS </a>, 
<a href="https://geodynamics.org/cig/software/pylith/" > LaMEM </a>,
<a href="https://bitbucket.org/ptatin/ptatin3d/src/master/" > ptatin3d </a>, 
<a href="https://geodynamics.org/cig/software/pylith/" > PyLith</a>, ...</p>


<p> All kinds of feedback is welcome on the text (grammar, typos, ...), the equations
or on the code(s). You will have my eternal gratitude if you wish to contribute an  
example, a benchmark, a cookbook, or even ask questions. </p>

<ul>
<li> All the python scripts and latex files are freely available on   
<a href="https://github.com/cedrict/fieldstone"> github </a>  </li>

<li> The 1400+ page/ 3800+ reference 
<a href="http://cedricthieulot.net/manual.pdf">pdf document</a>  </li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: unavoidably with such a wide ranging project like this
there are quite a few things in this huge document I probably do not understand
as well as I would want to, or that I am simply wrong about (I know: an academic acknowledges a weakness - how shocking). 
I sometimes write open questions in the text about such things. 
My commitment is to revisit this document time and time again, until it is 99% correct.
This is not a book, it has not been edited by anybody. It is not perfect in any way. 
I nevertheless hope it will be useful to many in the long run. </p>
